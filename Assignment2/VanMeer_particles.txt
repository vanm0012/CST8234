# My particle system is a small explosion.

There is an initial burst in the center as all the particles move outwards at different speeds and fade away slowly.

## For the particles attributes:

+ RGB for the colour of the particle is set to {0,0,0} becuase starting colour doesn't matter

+ All particles start at position 0,0

+ Speed is determined by multipling 0.1 with a pseudorandom integer in the range of 1 to 9

+ Direction is chosen with a switch statment and depends on a number chosen pseudorandomly

+ Life span is 100 + a pseudorandom int in the range of 0-100

## On each update cycle

+ For colour, each RGB value is randomly set to 1 or 0

+ The particle position is moved according to direction * speed

+ Lifespan is decreased by one and if it equals 0, the particle is removed from the linked list
